description: Planing and execution of a E-commerce blog around the bucket hat niche
---
Commonfolks is an online store focusing on delivering affordable, high-quality bucket hat products to worldwide customers.  

Ideation:  

The research was begun back when I did keyword research for a niche blog. I was looking for a low-competition niche topic to build a blog around. To my surprise, Ahrefs suggested that topics surrounding bucket hat have a high volume of search and are not very competitive.  

In addition to this, the more specific keyword of “black bucket hat”, “white bucket hat”, etc. are seen to be low in difficulty, still with rather high volume of search. This would possibly be a good long-tailed keyword to start ranking.  

I was skeptical with the result that Ahrefs gave me. And rightfully, using metrics from other SEO tools resulted in different difficulty score. Each tools use different formula to derive the difficulty score of a keyword. This pretty much means that the keyword was not as easy to rank as ahrefs shown.  

I went ahead anyway to see if I can rank for the keyword, and if proven not effective, see if I can drive traffic from other sources.  

Plan:  

The Website serves as an e-commerce platform as well as an infomercial blog surrounding the topic “Bucket Hat”. Customers can make a purchase through the website by selecting a product, adding them to their cart, adding payment details, and complete their payment with their selected payment gateway. Furthermore, users can read or learn about topics related to bucket hats, such as how to style a bucket hat, how it should fit, and so on. The blog’s main purpose is to drive engagement with our users through informational content, which is done to increase our brand authority to ultimately convert our visitors.  

Products are all picked and sourced from AliExpress. Picked products are chosen based on various considerations including but not limited to: product price, reviews and rating, delivery cost, design, supplier’s reputation, and so on.  

Marketing is done through social media channels. Mainly Instagram, tiktok, pinterest, and facebook are chosen as a starting point. Affiliate program/influencer marketing is also a possibility after we have built a good amount of authority through social media.  

Besides social media, our blog serves as a content marketing channel for keywords surrounding bucket hat. Targeting long-tail keywords especially questions about bucket hat is done parallel with social media marketing. Social media will also be used to promote our web content.  

Email marketing is done through subscription. Users can receive promotional content and offers through email by subscribing to our service. Promotional emails are to be sent regularly to remind customers of our existence and instruct our customers to read a blog post or make a purchase.  

SEM and display advertising also fall under consideration, but I decided to do this later after we start gaining organic converts.  

Execution:  

The website was built using Wordpress CMS coupled with WooCommerce plugin. WooCommerce was used for integration with Aliexpress. Every order will go through WooCommerce and get ordered through AliExpress pointing to the customer’s address.  

Yoast SEO is used together with Wordpress to quickly set metadata for the website and all pages in it. Additionally, Yoast supports SEO content checking. This is really helpful to evaluate our blog contents (inbound/outbound links, readability, preventing keyword stuffing, metadata evaluation, etc.) directly through Wordpress editor.  

Initial contents were made, specifically targeting long-tailed keywords such as “Black Bucket Hat” and “How Should a Bucket Hat Fit?”. Contents were made mostly informational, with added offers or mentions of products at the end of the content as the CTA.  

A Universal Analytics (UA) version of Google Analytics was connected for analytical purposes later on.  

Social media marketing is currently done through Pinterest, Instagram, and Tiktok. All visual designs are done using Canva. Canva is chosen for its social media support and access to premium, commercial-use elements. We use a simple excel document to track the growth of each social media.  

Pinterest  

Driving traffics from Pinterest is mainly done through pins. Pins are purely visual. Therefore, competition against other pins is done through an evaluation on which pin can catch the most attention of the potential customer. With this in mind, our created pins need to be visually appealing right from the start, separating themselves apart from all other pins of the same topic.  

Moreover, there is an addition of idea pins. These are multi-paged pins with added features from the usual pins. Our results suggested that idea pins were more likely to get viewed and interacted with. Most likely because there is less competition surrounding idea pins, which leads to more exposure.  

Currently, we have created two idea pins, derived from two of our blog contents. These contents are simplified and toned down for easier consumption. A link is provided for users who want to read more about the topic, leading to our website.  

There are still a lot of things to do with Pinterest. Bucket hat as a part of streetwear fashion item and fashion in general means we can expand our reach to these topics as well, which admittedly have more active community and discussions going compared to our specific topic. What can be done about this is joining collaborative streetwear/fashion/bucket hat boards to promote our content, following and sharing contents of aforementioned topics, and build our brand authority based on followers and boards.  

Instagram  

The method executed here fell under the gray-hat area of SEO. We employed mother-child account method in which a main account or mother account was given additional impression with the use of child accounts. Four child accounts are used to share viral contents and articles. Each four contains links to the mother account in the bio, post tags, and captions.  

The main account posts the same articles that were posted on our website. Furthermore, this account follows a certain number of accounts from the same niche.  

The child accounts employed a follow-unfollow method. That Is, each day the account will follow several people interacting with a certain topic or following another account of the same niche. Unfollows are done randomly each week.  

Instagram will later be used as our affiliate program channel. Using UTM tracking we can handle a small number of influencers to promote our business. It is still in consideration if we are going to use first-click or last-click attribution for this method. Affiliate program service would be preferred if not for the price.  

Tiktok  

Tiktok was used similarly to Instagram, but without the mother-child method. We post contents similar to our blog posts, targeting a combination of long-tailed and high-volume hashtags. Affiliate programs might also be possible through Tiktok.
